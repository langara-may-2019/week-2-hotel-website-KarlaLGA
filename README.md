# Week Two - Hotel Website
## Here we go! Let's start building up behaviour on a website!

This is a website for a boutique hotel where we will make it more exciting by using our JavaScript skills.

## For day one, we are going to make a drop down menu:

When you hover:

If you want to stretch yourself, then you can change the images, add more dropdowns or more pages on the navbar. Another thing you could
do is change the hover behavior on the navbar from css to jQuery.
### Have fun, and happy coding
