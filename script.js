// 1. Let's make a dropdown menu, by starting by selecting the 'about' nav li
// 2. Next, use the event of 'hover' by either using .on("hover", function...) or .hover(function...).
// 3. Next, add a callback function. 
// 4. select the ul and look into what you want the ul to do. Do a google search, and if you get stuck, look into what .stop() does, and what .slideDown() does. Look them up and see what they do. This is 95% of what developers do during their day. 
// 5. So we animated it to pop down, but now we need it to pop back up. Find out what the opposite of .slideDown is, and put that in your code.
// 6. STRETCH - try making this a different way. Maybe you could make it dissapear with a jquery function. The li is hidden by using the CSS display: none;. Remove the CSS, and use jquery to hide and reveal the menu. Or perhaps you could toggle a class on and off. The possibilities are endless!  


// Example Â ðŸ‘‡ 
// $('').on(" ",function() {
//       $('', this).something().something();
//     },
//     function() {
//       $('', this).something().something();
//     }
//   );
